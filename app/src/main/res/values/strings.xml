    <string name="defensepractice">Cover 6 is a coverage that blends Cover 2 and Cover 4 (2+4 = 6, get it?) principles, or quarter, quarter, half. The Cover 4/quarters side of the defense is just that, the defense plays quarters coverage and matches the vertical routes (anything past about eight yards is considered “vertical”) or drop into deep quarters on the wide side of the field. The Cover 2 side of the defense is played from the near hash to the sideline and employs a deep-half safety and a corner, who plays the flat or sinks on a vertical with the No. 1 receiver if no threat enters the flat:</string>
    <string name="offensepractice">The Jets are working the Smash-7 combo to the open side (No.2 on the ball is a pre-snap key to that combination) with the “Pin” concept to the closed side. The RB will release on the “whip” angle route, but Sanchez wants to work Plaxico Burress and Keller to the short side of the field.</string>
    <string name="wrdrill">Most catches are made while running or moving at full speed. Focus on moving your feet and catching the ball at the same time. This drill can also help receivers move laterally at the line of scrimmage to beat press coverage.</string>
    <string name="dbdril">This cornerback drill is intended for situations when the receiver runs a deeper comeback route and does manage to break your cushion. It\'s called open hip because when the receiver gets within three yards of you, you have to open up and begin to run with him. Depending on whether your coach wants you to open up to the inside in a zone turn our outside facing the receiver in a man turn, you will play this a bit different.</string>
